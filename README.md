dmenuTimer
==========
Simple dmenu based timer 

1. Add the `timer` file in bin dir or `/usr/local/bin`
2. Add the `timer_autostart_function` in autostart.sh or autostart script
3. For dwmblocks use `dwm_timer` (No need add 'timer_autostart_function')
4. Required `dunst` and `alsa` (if other than alsa change the player to play the wav file)
>Note :
5. logo and wav files in `dtimer` dir move it to any dir and update the path in the script or `mv dtimer ~/.config/`
6. wav file is so mild if you want you can change the logo and wav file
